### Arquitetura e Desenho de Software @ ISCTE 2023/2024

The github-pages deployment of this project emulates a webpage built to improve the quality of ISCTE's scheduling.
It will automatically schedule classrooms to a year long calendar of classes.

Two .csv files are needed to use this application:
- the available classrooms and their respective features
- a year long calendar of ISCTE's classes

Example files are stored at: TODO. These can be downloaded and modified to get different results.
