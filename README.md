### Arquitetura e Desenho de Software @ ISCTE 2023/2024

The github-pages deployment of this project emulates a webpage built to improve the quality of ISCTE's scheduling.
It will automatically schedule classrooms to a year long calendar of classes.

Example files are stored at: TODO. These can be downloaded and modified to get different results.

## Features

- Automatic assignment of classrooms to a year long schedule
- Downloadable .csv file of the resulting schedule
- Preview of the .csv files
- Selection of .csv columns used

- Selection of .csv separator, time format and date format
- Quality criteria for each produced schedule, such as: capacity wasted, number of features wasted, etc.
- Configuration through a .json file, that can be both downloaded and uploaded
